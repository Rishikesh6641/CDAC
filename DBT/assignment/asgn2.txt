1) Which field of the Customers table is the primary key?
->Cnum;

2) What is the 4th column of the Customers table?
-> Rating;

3) What is another word for row? For column?
->Column are called has attribute or key,and row can be called has tuple Entity;

4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
->in RDBMS the row are not stored sequentially they are stored in any specific
order
rows of the table are scattered fragmented all over the DB server HD
the resone wht RDBMS do this is to make insert opreation faster
in multi user envoirment when multiple user are inserting row in the same table 
simultaneously if mysql where to store the rows sequentially, then the insert operation will be very slow
when you insert a table wherever Mysql finds the free space in the db server HD, it will store the row
when you select from the row the searching is sequential 
when you select from a table ,the order of rows in the output will depend on the row address it will always  
be in asending order of row address
once you insert the row the row address will be constant 
when you update the row and if the lengthg is increasing and free space is not available then the entire 
row is moved to some other address on the DB server HD
hence it is not possible to select first n rows and the last n rows of the table
its common for all RDBMS;
